## Restart Canary

Chrome canary will only allow localhost to have an IP other than 127.0.0.1 on first run. Restarting Canary is necessary to get the latest update, which will cause any localhost not pointed at 127.0.0.1 to break. This workflow closes Canary, removes the Local State file, and re-opens Canary so that localhost continues to work.
